Recap\n","\n","In Python Tutorial 1, you learned about carrying out **computations** with numbers stored in **variables**. We hope you saw the advantage of using Python for **repeated computations** since you can adjust the variables' values and re-run the code as many times as you need. In this tutorial, we'll learn about how you can place your repeated computations **in your own functions**."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ocILk2W_U3mU"},"source":["# 2. A function is a repeatable segment of code\n","\n","In mathematics, a **function** is relationship or set of instructions that maps one value onto another. If $f(x) = x^2$, then we can say that $f$ maps the **input value** $x$ onto an **output value** $x^2$. We can even make a function of multiple inputs, like the magnitude of a position vector: $r(x,y) = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The single out $r$ is determined by two inputs $x$ and $y$.\n","\n","In Python, a function works much the same way. We can specify any number of input variables and any number of output variables.

Keeping track of variables\n","\n","The input variables of a function change each time they are called, and once the function is finished, Python forgets them.
