Recap\n","\n","In Python Tutorial 1, you learned about carrying out **computations** with numbers stored in **variables**. It was great to see how you could change the value of a varaible and immediately carry out the same computation based on the new value. But sometimes you want your code to carry out a different computation based on the values you have. In this case, **we can use control statements to give Python conditional instructions**."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QyT9-Jxk-tKs"},"source":["# 2. A control statement gives you options for what your code does\n","\n","For example, suppose we were working with a **piecewise function** like the step function:\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","S(x) = \\left\\{  \\begin{array}{cc} 0 & \\textrm{if } x \\leq 0 \\\\ 1 & \\textrm{if } x > 0 \\end{array} \\right.\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","We could implement this important function if we could give Python two sets of instructions: One set of instructions to follow if $x$ is positive and one set to follow if $x$ is not positive.\n","\n","# 3. A control statement is structured using ``if`` and ``else``\n","\n","In the code cell below, we use the ``if`` and ``else`` keywords to create the step function. Line 5 uses ``if`` to indicate that Python should check for whether the statement ``x > 0`` is true; it's like asking a question. If this statement is true, then Python executes all the indented lines after the ``:``. This setup is very similar to a loop.\n","\n","We then use ``else`` in Line 9 to specify what Python should do if ``x > 0`` is false. This is the alternative set of instructions. Again, Python will execute all the indented lines after the ``:``. When the lines are no longer indented, the control statement is finished.\n","\n","Change the value of ``x`` in the code cell below to different positive and negative values and run the code cell each time.

Example: Telling even from odd.\n","\n","Let's try something that will prove useful to us later: Asking Python whether a number is even or odd. There's a special operator called the **modulus** that makes this question straightforward to evaluate. Python uses the ``%`` symbol for the modulus, such that ``7%3`` is \"eight modulus three.\" The modulus operator returns the **remainder** leftover when we divide the first number by the second number. So, ``7%3`` would give us ``1``, since $7/3 = 2$ with a remainder of $1$.\n","\n","If we wanted to tell whether ``n`` was even or odd, we could use ``n%2`` and identify whether the answer is ``1`` ($n$ is odd) or ``0`` ($n$ is even).
